    <section class="color">
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        refers to the carefully selected site colors that reflect the organization's purpose and trademark. The planning document defines the color scheme through a color palette that labels color style definitions and swatches for site elements. Define at least two colors and show where each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, accents, and so on.

    <section class="typo">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>
          
            The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are to be applied. No less than one font and no more than three fonts selections need to be selected. Indicate where each selected font will be used (such as headings, body, and so on). Other fonts can be used for special circumstances or sections as needed. When choosing web fonts, consider factors such as readability, compatibility, and the overall aesthetic of your website. Additionally, always check the licensing terms of the fonts you plan to use to ensure they align with your project's requirements.
